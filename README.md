# Overview
This example shows how [scribe.js](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribe.js) can be used with Vue.js v2 to make a web application.  Vue.js v2 has reached [end of life](https://v2.vuejs.org/eol/), so this is only recommended for existing Vue.js v2 users.  

This repo was created using the [Vue CLI tool](https://cli.vuejs.org/), and everything below this section in the README is boilerplate from that tool.  As Vue.js v2 uses Webpack as its build tool, all non-default settings used here in [vue.config.js](./vue.config.js) are copied from the [Scribe.js Webpack v5 example repo](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribe.js-example-webpack5).  See [that repo](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribe.js-example-webpack5) for more information regarding using Scribe.js with Webpack.
